CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):
  Policy CMP0048 is not set: project() command manages VERSION variables.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0048" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy

    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
    CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
